# BaBuild a one-year streng1. **Auto-Compute Daily Data**
   - On page load, calculate days elapsed since start_date (Day 1 = start_date).
   - Determine if today is a training day (Mon-Fri) or rest day (Sat-Sun).
   - Determine the current training day number and which day type it is (A, B, A', or B').
   - Calculate weights for each lift using the linear‚Äìlog curve and Epley formula.
   - Display current day info and the next training day below.

2. **Daily Display**
   - **Training Day Title**: `Week N ‚Ä¢ <date> ‚Ä¢ Day A|B|A'|B' ‚Ä¢ Training Day #`
   - **Rest Day Title**: `Week N ‚Ä¢ <date> ‚Ä¢ Rest Day`
   - For each lift on training days:
     ```
     Squat ‚Äî 2√ó5 ‚Äî Total: ### lb ‚Ä¢ Plates/side: #.# lb
     ```
     or for pullups:
     ```

   - On rest days, show "Rest" message and display the next two training days below.
   - On training days, display the next training day in the same format below.ner that:
- Uses a **linear‚Äìlog progression curve** to calculate daily weights.
- Alternates between **Day A** (Squat, Overhead Press, Pullup) and **Day B** (Deadlift, Bench, Row).
- Trains Monday‚ÄìFriday, rests Saturday‚ÄìSunday.
- Has an **every-8th-week deload** (weeks 8, 16, 24, etc.).
- Alternates between 5 and 8 reps in a 4-day cycle: A (5 reps), B (5 reps), A' (8 reps), B' (8 reps).
  - **Exception**: Squat and Deadlift always use 5 reps.
- Displays the **current day's lifts** and the **next training day's lifts** below for quick reference.
- On rest days, shows "Rest" with the next two training days displayed below.

## üéØ Goal

Build a one-year strength training planner that:
- Uses a **linear‚Äìlog progression curve** to calculate daily weights.
- Alternates between **Day A** (Squat, Overhead Press, Pullup) and **Day B** (Deadlift, Bench, Row).
- Runs 5 days per week with an **every-8th-week deload**.
- For each exercise, alternates between 5 rep or 8 reps (configurable)
- Displays the **current day‚Äôs lifts** and **alternate day‚Äôs lifts** below for quick scrolling.

The webpage will be fully static ‚Äî a single `index.html` file that performs all calculations locally via embedded JSON and JavaScript.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Description

1. **Auto-Compute Daily Data**
   - On page load, determine today‚Äôs training week and whether it‚Äôs an A or B day.
   - Calculate weights for each lift using the linear‚Äìlog curve and display them.
   - Include **alternate day** numbers below the main display (so both A and B are visible).

2. **Daily Display**
   - Title: `Week N ‚Ä¢ <date> ‚Ä¢ Day A|B`
   - For each lift:
     ```
     Squat ‚Äî Total: ### lb ‚Ä¢ Plates/side: #.# lb
     ```
     or for pullups:
     ```
     Pullup ‚Äî Add: #.# lb (System: BW + Add)
     ```
   - Below this, display the alternate day in the same format.

3. **Rounding & Precision**
   - Each lift rounds independently to its configured increment.

4. **Plate Math**
   - Uses a standard plate inventory (e.g., 45/25/10/5/2.5).
   - Greedy fill algorithm for plate assignment.

5. **Deload Logic**
   - Every 8th week, multiply all weights by `deload_factor` (default 0.70).
   - Resume curve progression afterward (not a reset).

## üßÆ Calculation Formulas

### 1. Goal 1RM

```
W_goal(lift) = goal_bw_multiple[lift] * bodyweight_lb
```

> For pull-ups: this represents **additional weight** beyond bodyweight.

### 2. Start 1RM

```
W_start(lift) = start_as_pct_of_goal[lift] * W_goal(lift)
```

### 3. Linear‚ÄìLog Progression

Calculate the projected 1RM for a given week:

$$
W(t) = W_{start} + (W_{goal} - W_{start}) \cdot \frac{\ln(1+\alpha t)}{\ln(1+\alpha T)}
$$

Where:

* `t` = current week (0-indexed: week 1 = t=0, week 2 = t=1, etc.)
* `T` = total weeks - 1
* `Œ±` = curvature constant controlling how front-loaded progress is
* Clamp `t` between `[0, T]`

### 4. Working Weight Conversion (Epley Formula)

Convert the 1RM to working weight based on the number of reps for that day:

$$
WorkingWeight = \frac{W(t)}{1 + \frac{r}{30}}
$$

* `r` = reps per set for this specific training day
  - For Day A and B: use 5 reps (unless exercise has `alternate_reps: false`)
  - For Day A' and B': use 8 reps (unless exercise has `alternate_reps: false`)
  - Squat and Deadlift always use 5 reps
* If deload week (weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48) ‚Üí `WorkingWeight *= deload_factor`
* Round to nearest increment for that lift.

### 5. Plate Math

```
PlatesPerSide = (WorkingWeight - bar_weight_lb) / 2
```

Then fill from largest to smallest plate in the available inventory.

### 6. Day Mapping

* Calculate days elapsed: `days_elapsed = current_date - start_date` (where start_date is Day 1)
* Determine day of week: if Saturday or Sunday ‚Üí Rest Day
* Calculate training day number: count only Mon-Fri days since start_date
* Determine cycle position: `cycle_index = (training_day_number - 1) % 4`
  - 0 ‚Üí Day A (5 reps)
  - 1 ‚Üí Day B (5 reps)  
  - 2 ‚Üí Day A' (8 reps)
  - 3 ‚Üí Day B' (8 reps)
* Calculate week number: `week = floor((training_day_number - 1) / 5) + 1`
* On rest days, display "Rest" and show the next two training days

## üß† Implementation Notes

* Single file (`index.html`) ‚Äî all logic inline.
* JavaScript-only (no frameworks).
* Core functions:

  * `parseConfig()`
  * `getDaysElapsed(startDate, currentDate)`
  * `getTrainingDayNumber(startDate, currentDate)` - counts only Mon-Fri
  * `isRestDay(date)` - checks if Sat/Sun
  * `getCyclePosition(trainingDayNumber)` - returns A, B, A', or B'
  * `getWeekNumber(trainingDayNumber)`
  * `isDeloadWeek(weekNumber)` - checks if week 8, 16, 24...
  * `getRepsForExercise(lift, cyclePosition)` - returns 5 or 8 based on alternation
  * `compute1RM(lift, weekNumber)`
  * `computeWorkingWeight(oneRM, reps, isDeload)`
  * `plateMath(workingWeight, barWeight, plateInventory)`
  * `renderTrainingDay(dayType, trainingDayNumber)`
  * `renderRestDay(nextTrainingDays)`
* Use semantic HTML and system fonts.
